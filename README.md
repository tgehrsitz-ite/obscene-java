# Obscene Java

_Cool name, isn't it?_

This is just my collection of little things in the Java language that are probably unexpected or look funny - or spooky at first.

Also keep in mind that this is more a collection of failures and puzzles, so it might be the opposite of good code.

**Obviously, this is targeted to kids or very junior programmers.**

Hopefully it will grow over time, this is only the start and a place to put in the things I stumble over in my or others code and to not forget about them.
